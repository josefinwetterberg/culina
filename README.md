# Culina

**Culina** is web service constructed in React and Vite and which utilizes TheMealDB database and its API.
It allows users to search and view various culinary recipes for easy ingredient gathering and meal preparation.

## Features

A search function able to find meals from a large database depending on:
- Name
- Included ingredients
- Meal category

Recipe pages for all meals including:
- Reuired ingredients and measurements
- Written instructions for meal preparation
- Linked video tutorials
- An image of each meal

## Opening the site

1. We host Culina through the vercel platform. You can enter the site by opening this link on which it is hosted:
https://culina-azure.vercel.app/

2. Alternatively, you may clone the repository into a folder of your choosing and host it locally.

First open up your console and navigate to the folder to which you want to clone it, entering this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/josefinwetterberg/culina.git
```

With the console in your cloned directory then enter the command:
```
npm run dev
```
Afterwards you should see the confirmation message and the port which it is hosted on (usually 3000).
You should then be able to enter the address into your preffered browser like so: http://localhost:3000.
